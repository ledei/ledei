## 🧑‍💻 About me 
For as long as I can remember I have always loved
 technology and programming, but it always seemed a
 bit intimidating. A few years ago, I am in a new city and
 I jump at the opportunity to study programming to
 become a frontend-developer. As I keep progressing
 my passion for coding grows and so does the smile on
 my face
